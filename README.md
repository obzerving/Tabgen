# Tabgen
 Inkscape extension for putting tabs and scorelines on closed paths

Given a closed path of straight lines, this program generates a paper model of tabs and score lines for each straight edge.

Installing:
 
Copy tabgen.inx and tabgen.py into your Inkscape user extensions directory. Where is that? Open Inkscape and go to the System section of the Preferences menu (Edit --> Preferences --> System). You will find a User extensions item containing the path to your user extensions directory.

Usage:

See the file [Usage_guide_tabgen.pdf](https://github.com/obzerving/Tabgen/blob/main/Usage_guide_tabgen.pdf) for details.

In addition, the extension has been updated to allow a color to be selected for a solid score line (dashlength = 0.0).

Note:

This extension (for Inkscape version 1.1.) is functional, but not bulletproof, so be mindful of the input constraints in the usage document.
